# Mini-tasks

### Some rules for implementations
- Main purpose of this folder is to learn about basic algorithms
  and to find out when to use them.
- It's okay to use popular libs to solve problems, but preferable
  way is to code it with your own hands, and then optimize.

### Preferable order of tasks (from easy to hard)
* Creation Of String:
  function should detect ability to create one word from another.
* Check matches:
  function should detect matches between 2 arrays of numbers
* Flatter:
  function should convert multi-level array info 1-level (flat) array
* Calc:
  function should be able to accumulate values (numbers) and then
  apply special function to list of accumulated values
* Distinct by ID:
  function should be able to filter out items with equal IDs
* Distinct by double IDs:
  function should be able to filter out items with equal set of IDs
  (first from start of array of values should remain)
* Custom sort:
  function should sort "array of values" according to provided "order array";
  if value does not exist in "order array", then values should be moved to the end
  of resulting array (as if it matched with last value of order array)
* Create tree:
  function should create multi-level node-tree from flat array of items

### SQL-task:
You can find them in `\sql-tasks` folder. Each task must be solved in request (1 query).
